# Contributing to Cybernetic

Cybernetic is open-source, meaning that you can view and contribute to the source code of Cybernetic! By following the below guidelines, you can work with the Cybernetic community to make Cybernetic the best bot it can be.

## How do I contribute to Cybernetic?

There's a wide variety of ways you can help! You don't have to be proficient in JavaScript/Node\.js/Discord\.js to contribute - in fact, you don't even have to know how to code! Here's some of the ways you can contribute:

- Adding/Suggesting features to the bot
- Opening issues about the bot
- Resolving issues about the bot
- Making your own bug reports

## Guidelines

In general, just be constructive and not toxic. Always try to be positive and use appropriate language. Please follow the liesence of this project, which is GPLC 3.0

If you dont know much about coding in JavaScript, there are many places to learn like https://www.freecodecamp.org,
but Cybernetic isnt really the best place to test things out.

If you are considering to add code to Cybernetic, when your done make a pull request for the Cybernetic Team to look
at. 

Cybernetic is an all purpose bot, which means that one day we hope that it functions as a Music Bot, Moderation Bot, Minecraft Bot etc. Before adding a command to this
category, please contact me through Discord, which has been recently renamed to \`ultimate_hecker#1165\`.

Thank you for your coroperations and contributions to Cybernetic
