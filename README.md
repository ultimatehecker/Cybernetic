A free very easy to use Discord Client to interact with the hypixel and mojang API. This client is still under beta, and has not been fully released yet. If you are running a stable version of Cybernetic, the client should work how it is intended to, unless it is determined by the owner that it is very unstable, which will uaully lead to a bug fix within 3 days. If you are running any unstable version of Cybernetic, then bugs will appear. If you find any feel free to submit an issue on the GitHub repository. If you have any features for Cybernetic, make an issue in GitHub, but please make sure that it very clearly says that it is a feature.
